# PythonFinalProject

This project focuses on identifying personal information (phone numbers or email addresses) in image files and automatically masking the data.

I used Google Colab for this project, and the main script is configured to leverage Colab functionality.  Knowing that PyTesseract requires addition setup on a local machine, I do not expect this to work directly without additional configuration.

Feel free to view the Google Colab notebook for verification and testing:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XBGkT-BmxEB1u9TxmfzaZelc33AByeke?usp=sharing

Note: You will need to manually download the example images provided here and upload them to the images directory created in the script.
